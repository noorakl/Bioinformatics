4. Sequences from which species is/are most closely related to that of the "Flying Fox"?
Rousettus leschenaultii, Cynopterus sphinx, Syconycteris australis, Dobsonia viridis, Epomophorus wahlbergi. 

5. Why might such a phylogeny be useful in light of current event
Because phylogenic trees can help to provide insight on evolution of some species and phylogeny can help us to classify organisms based on their ancestral connections.
